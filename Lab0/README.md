# Lab 0 Machine Set up

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to set up your development environment with the bare minimumto continue onto future labs.

1. Create a version controlled project repository for the semester and a hosted version. Thiswill be the same repository to submit all future assignments for the remainder of thesemester. This Git project repository will be the same project connected with either yourLinux Machine account, your local development machine, or possibly both.
2. From your linux machine, clone the GitHub repository that you’ve created.
3. Those who are going to the campus computer lab exclusively do not need to complete this next part.From your development machine (i.e. your laptop), open a terminal interface and clonethe GitHub repository that you’ve created.
4. From either of the development environments (either your machine or the Linux Sys-tem from Brooklyn College WEB lab), create anAUTHOR￿le that contains brie￿y autobi-ographical information. This may include your major, the focus of your studies, careerinterests and experiences, as well as any hobbies. Add this ￿le to the git repository to betracked by your repo and synced to your GitHub repo.
